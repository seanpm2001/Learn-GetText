#, About:
#, I decided to make GetText the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-GetText) as GetText is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the GetText programming language. It only makes sense to GetText the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
